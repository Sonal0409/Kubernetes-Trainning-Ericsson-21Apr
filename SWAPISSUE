Step 1: Turn off swap immediately
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo swapoff -a
Step 2: Permanently disable swap by editing /etc/fstab
Open the file:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo nano /etc/fstab
Find the line that contains swap and comment it out by adding a # at the beginning. It will look something like:

bash
Copy
Edit
# /swap.img none swap sw 0 0
Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X in nano).
